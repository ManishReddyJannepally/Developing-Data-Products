#Top 10 populated countries in the World 2017
        
I have collected the top 10 populated countries along with their latitudes and longitudes from google. I converted all the co-ordinates to N and W form and formed a data set.The radius of circles indicate their population. FYI, I have reduced the scale of population by dividing the population by 500.

```{r Markdown & Leaflet Assignment, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
Top10_pops = data.frame(Rank = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), Country = c("China","India",
                "U.S","Indonasia","Brazil","Pakistan","Nigeria","Bangladesh","Russia","Mexico"),
                Polulation=c(1388232693,1342512706,326474013,263510146,211243220,196744376,191835936                 ,164827718,143375006,130222815),lat = c(35.8617,20.5937,37.0902,-0.7893,-14.2350,
                30.3753,9.0820,23.6850,61.5240,23.6345),lng = c(104.1954,78.9629,-95.7129,113.9213,
                -51.9253,69.3451,8.6753,90.3563,105.3188,-102.5528))
Top10_pops$Polulation = as.numeric(Top10_pops$Polulation)
Top10_pops$pop = Top10_pops$Polulation/500
Top10_pops %>% 
        leaflet()%>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(lat = Top10_pops$lat, lng = Top10_pops$lng,
                   popup = paste(Top10_pops$Rank,Top10_pops$Country,sep = ".")) %>%
        addCircles(weight=1,lat = Top10_pops$lat, lng = Top10_pops$lng,radius=Top10_pops$pop)
